I am a senior at the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu/) double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have interned at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) and [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) in independent research roles. My ongoing work at the Environmental Science Division at Argonne focuses on developing data pipelines and models to support the national AI flood mapping project. You can find some of my projects [here](https://github.com/davdma).

My projects include:
* **(Current)** Flood mapping using multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
* Measuring kinase inhibitor polypharmacology
* PFAS bioaccumulation cheminformatic modeling
